# Understanding Users, Roles, and Permissions

A _**user**_ is anyone who accesses and uses Ezra360. Users are assigned _**permissions**_ which determine the information they can access and the tasks they can perform. Permissions can be assigned to users either directly or through a role. \
\
A _**role**_ is a way to group permissions and to control other forms of access within Ezra360.\
\
**Ezra360 is compliant with POPIA. Among other features, Ezra360 supports:**

* Masking sensitive fields by security roles.
* Separation of duties.
* Security Role managed security.
* Limitation to download sensitive data by role.

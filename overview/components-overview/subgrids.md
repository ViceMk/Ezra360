# Subgrids

**Subgrids** are small grids or lists of related records that appear within a form. Subgrids provide a way to display and interact with data from a related entity directly within the context of the current record being viewed.

The add button on <mark style="color:orange;">**#1**</mark> opens a form to add details\
_For example_, in the subgrid below, it displays all the associated employee leave related to that Employee. This subgrid allows you to see and interact with these related activities without leaving the Employee record form and to add a new record you click the <mark style="color:orange;">**#1**</mark> button.

Subgrids in Ezra can be used to display and manage various related records, depending on the relationships established in the data model.

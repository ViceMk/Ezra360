# Forms

Forms are user interfaces that allows user to view, enter and edit data related to a specific entity. They are used to interact with records and perform various action within Ezra360. We have  different forms namely, **Main** form, **Quick Create** form, and **Portal** form, **Mobile** Form.

**Main Form:**\
The main form is the comprehensive primary form for a specific entity, and it contains essential fields and information related to that entity. It is mainly used when users access the entity directly through direct links. They provide complete view of the entity, allowing users to perform **CRUD** operations (_Create, Read, Update, Delete_) depending on their security roles. Which has multiple buttons to choose from that makes action to the entity.\
On <mark style="color:orange;">**#1**</mark> of the image below shows an example of a main form.\

**Process Form**\
Process forms are designed to present fields and information in a logical sequence, helping users complete tasks, and perform actions in a structured manner. They are particularly useful for capturing data and interactions related to well-defined business processes.

**Quick Create Form:**\
Quick forms are more compact and focused forms designed to show specific key information about an entity. They are used in scenarios where you need to see critical details quickly without the need for a full view of the record. Quick Create forms are often embedded in dashboards, views, or other areas where space is limited, and users require concise information at a glance.\

To access quick forms in a sub-grid, use the <mark style="color:orange;">**#1**</mark> "**+**" button to open a quick form.

The quick create form will be opened as a pop up on the screen. <mark style="color:orange;">**#2**</mark> shows the opened quick form in the middle of the screen. When you click <mark style="color:orange;">**#3**</mark> it will maximize the quick form and then open it in a main form with detailed view.

**Portal Form:**\
Portal forms are specifically designed to enable external users (such as customers, partners, or suppliers) to interact with the data through your web portal in Ezra. Portal forms can be customized to match the branding and requirements of the external-facing website, allowing seamless data interaction between Ezra360 and portal users.

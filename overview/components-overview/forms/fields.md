# Fields

In <mark style="color:orange;">**Ezra**</mark><mark style="color:purple;">**360**</mark>, **Fields** are individual data elements or attributes that store specific information about an entity (such as a customer, opportunity, or product). Fields are used to capture and represent various types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, options, and more.

When you open a form in Ezra360 to view or edit a record, you will see different fields displayed within the form. Each field corresponds to a particular piece of information related to the entity. For example, in the _Banking Details_ record, you will find field for the <mark style="color:orange;">**1#**</mark> Bank name, Account Number, Type of Account, Branch Code. These are all fields for the "Banking details" **section** in a "Details" **Tab**

# Views

**Views** help organize and present data in a way that is relevant to the user's needs. By selecting a particular view, you can quickly filter and display records that match the criteria set by that view. This makes it easier to focus on relevant information without being overwhelmed by unnecessary data. All views are customizable to fit entity processes and functionality.
